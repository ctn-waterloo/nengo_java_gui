Nengo User Manual
===========================================

`Nengo <http://nengo.ca>`_ is a software package for simulating large-scale neural systems.

To use it, you define groups of neurons in terms of what they represent, and then form connections between neural 
groups in terms of what computation should be performed on those representations. Nengo then uses the Neural 
Engineering Framework (NEF) to solve for the appropriate synaptic connection weights to achieve this desired 
computation. This makes it possible to produce detailed spiking neuron models that implement complex 
high-level cognitive algorithms.
