Combining 1D Representations into a 2D Representation
================================================================
*Purpose*: This demo shows how to construct a network that combines two 1D inputs into a 2D representation.

*Comments*: This can be thought of as two communication channels projecting to a third population, but instead of combining the input (as in addition), the receiving population represents them as being independent.

*Usage*: Grab the slider controls and move them up and down to see the effects of increasing or decreasing input. Notice that the output population represents both dimensions of the input independently, as can be seen by the fact that each input slider only changes one dimension in the output.

*Output*: See the screen capture below
