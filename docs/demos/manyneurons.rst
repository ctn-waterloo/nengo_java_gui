Population of Neurons
==============================================

*Purpose*: This demo shows how to construct and manipulate a population of neurons.

*Comments*: These are 100 leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The neuron tuning properties have been randomly selected. 

*Usage*: Grab the slider control and move it up and down to see the effects of increasing or decreasing input. As a population, these neurons do a good job of representing a single scalar value. This can be seen by the fact that the input graph and neurons graphs match well.

*Output*: See the screen capture below
