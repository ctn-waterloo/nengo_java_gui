A Controlled Question Answering Network
==============================================
*Purpose*: This demo performs question answering based on storing items in a working memory, while under control of a basal ganglia.

*Comments*: This example is very much like the question answering with memory demo (it would be good to read that).  However, both the information to bind and the questions to answer come in through the same visual channel.  The basal ganglia decides what to do with the information in the visual channel based on its content (i.e. whether it is a statement or a question).

*Usage*: When you run the network, it will start by binding 'RED' and 'CIRCLE' and then binding 'BLUE' and 'SQUARE' so the memory essentially has RED*CIRCLE + BLUE*SQUARE.  It does this because it is told that RED*CIRCLE is a STATEMENT (i.e. RED*CIRCLE+STATEMENT in the code) as is BLUE*SQUARE.  Then it is presented with something like QUESTION+RED (i.e., 'What is red?'). The basal ganglia then reroutes that input to be compared to what is in working memory and the result shows up in the motor channel. 

*Output*: See the screen capture below.
