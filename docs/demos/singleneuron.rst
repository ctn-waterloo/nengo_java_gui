A Single Neuron
================================================

*Purpose*: This demo shows how to construct and manipulate a single neuron.

*Comments*: This leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron is a simple, standard model of a spiking single neuron. It resides inside a neural 'population', even though there is only one neuron. 

*Usage*: Grab the slider control and move it up and down to see the effects of increasing or decreasing input. This neuron will fire faster with more input (an 'on' neuron). 

*Output*: See the screen capture below
