Simple Vehicle
================================================
*Purpose*: This demo shows an example of integrating Nengo with a physics engine renderer.  

*Comments*: The demo shows a simple Braitenburg vehicle controller attached to a simulated robot (a Dalek from Dr. Who), that drives in a physical simluation.

Most of the code is demonstrating how to construct a simple robot and a simple room in the physical simulator.  Only the last few lines are used to construct the neural controller.

*Usage*: Hit play and the robot will drive around, avoiding the blocks and walls.  The spikes are generated by measurements of distance from obstacles, and motor commands to the wheels.

*Output*: See the screen capture below.
