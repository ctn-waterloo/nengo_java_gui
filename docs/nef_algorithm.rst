A Minimal Implementation of the NEF Algorithm
================================================

While Nengo provides a flexible, general-purpose approach to neural modelling,
it is sometimes useful to get a complete look at exactly what is going on
"under the hood".  The theory behind the Neural Engineering Framework is
developed at length in `Eliasmith & Anderson, 2003: "Neural Engineering" 
<http://www.amazon.com/Neural-Engineering-Representation-Neurobiological-Computational/dp/0262550601>`_, 
and a short summary is available in `Stewart, 2012: "A Technical Overview of the
Neural Engineering Framework <http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/node/297>`_.

However, for some people, the best description of an algorithm is the code
itself.  With that in mind, the following is a complete implementation of the
NEF for the special case of two one-dimensional populations with a single
connection between them.  You can adjust the function being computed, the
input to the system, and various neural parameters.  In it written in Python,
and requires Numpy (for the matrix inversion) and Matplotlib (to produce graphs
of the output).
