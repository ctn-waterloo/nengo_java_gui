 Done
*******************************************
(08/09) - Some user preferences are saved to file
(08/09) - GFrame remembers user preferences in a serialized user configuration file
(08/09) - Plot decoded origins
(08/09) - Plot spikes
(08/09) - Set/view documentation
(08/09) - Tooltips with heterogeneous node information added

(08/08) done - Two types of Transient UI feedback for events such as File Save, New connections, etc...
	Events which modify NEO models should now have UI feedback
(08/08) done - Remove probes, probes are also updated from the Simulator using getProbes
(08/08) done - fixed infinite loop bug when GProbe is destroyed
(08/08) done - fixed some Swing thread safety issues

(08/08) done - size of ensembles & networks proportional to number of nodes
(08/07) done - save/open ensembles
(08/07) done - Plot Functions
(08/07) done - added option to remove projections from terminations
(08/07) done - hide/show origins and terminations
(08/07) done - automatically show origins and terminations on hover over

(08/07) done - Preliminary Ensemble Viewer created
(08/07) done - fixed some bugs with UI connections not detaching correctly

done - File menu, to load saved networks (Use Swing File Dialogs)
done - Save network from NetworkViewer, or PNetwork

done - undo /redo
done - It would be nice to have an easy way to maximize the network viewer
	(controls in upper-right corner like windows would be good)
done- When a node is deleted, its origins and terminations should also be deleted
done- There should be either scrollbars or a fit-on-screen function (I
	lost a function in the infinite network viewer)

*******************************************
 Pri 0 - doing next
*******************************************
Bug: Could not receive keyboard events from piccolo
make text window for inputting doumentation bigger

show simulation progress in UI
	create a listener object for Simulator

set simulator

information visualization
	dimensions of functions, nodes

*******************************************
 Pri 1 - to do
*******************************************

minimize all windows action


Connection Weights
- I think I know why it isn't acting as an integrator -- it looks like
there is no way to set connection weights on a projection? (something
like a spreadsheet-style matrix editor would be good)


redo functionality to allow duplicate actions to be performed

unconnected lines should be highlighted
*******************************************
 Pri 2 - will do eventually
*******************************************
debug paint calls using PDebug

add keyboard shortcuts

Rectangular group select cursor

optimize data structures

2) Methods getDocumentation() and setDocumentation() added to Node.
(Although I think we were going to defer documentation until later.) I
thought about using wrappers, but this would be a bit of a nuissance
as we would have to wrap NodeFactory instances for the UI. Let me know
if you have any thoughts on this.

Contiunous updating layouts (ie SpringLayout).

getInformation method for Nodes, for tooltips

units selection for UI Dialog

convert Iconfiguration's isConfigured option to a exception thrown and caught by ConfigManager

Complete java docs

Edit properties of existing models

keyboard search of nodes (auto-panning)

For Jung Layout algorithms, consider making WorldObject a Vertice, or making a Vertice Wrapper for world objects

hot keys to change the level of semantic detail in the view. ie. press ctrl to see Node properties

Write an short instruction doc

*******************************************
 Pri 3 - maybe if there's time
*******************************************
Lenses

Customize FileChooser to add extensions

	
Ctrl-key to enable popups (even when autopops are turned off)


*******************************************
 Bugs
*******************************************
bug: ensure threads are safety accessing the piccolo graph
bug: debug the events related with adding and removing connections
bug: window appears underneath lines and widgets

*******************************************
 Bryan requests
*******************************************
Ensemble's don't have metadata, can't save layout information

visualization... what information should be most visible? how to edit
what are the ways to create an ensemble?

more Network examples

Require events notification
	show scopes data in real time from the UI

talk about brain view
