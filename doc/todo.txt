03/22/2008 - PropertyDescriptors (used to construct a ConfigDialog) now have a setDescription and 
				getDescription which affects the tooltip. You can also pass in the Description via the constructor.
				PropertyTypes are now not shown in the Dialog, you can hover over the property to see that.
				

03/16/2008 - Added rename to Node menu
03/16/2008 - Name conflicts are resolved on paste, and drag-drop

03/16/2008 - Limited drag & drop functionality added. Can only drag-drop top->down. 
			Cannot drag & drop from inside to outside of a Container			
03/16/2008 - Cut & Paste moves the model, Copy & Paste uses cloning
03/16/2008 - Modified paste functionality to paste into the NodeContainer at the center of the screen
			before, it was whichever NodeContainer was maximized

*******************************************
 Pri 0 - doing next
*******************************************
Events to pass more information like the node it occured one. 
	Selectionhandler should attach on destroy events to remove item from selection 

Need to create UIFiles directory

Add listener to catch name changes of the children of NengoGraphics

Add ability to surface DataType and Description for Fields of PropertyInputPanel

Scroll the other way when a mouse is dragged off the screen

Update ensemble, network, and function icons to be Vector

- While waiting for an ensemble or origin to build, is it possible to
animate something, to convince the user there hasn't been a crash?
Maybe the flashing effect like while the add origin/termination
dialogs are up?
	V2 Feature


Elastic forces should be assynmetrical between two objects ( proportional to weight of base object )

Auto-remove dangling probes and projections when a Network is updated
	Detect projection removals, scan through all origins and terminations, 
	looking for projections, then remove the one's which don't exist anymore

Disable zoom & panning while animating camera (use isAnimating())

Run memory test to find leaks

Create more advanced tests
	Create, delete, modify nodes

UIProjections
	disconnections should be done in UINetwork level through updateViewFromModel()


Show popover message when model is updated
	Consolidate all viewer updates in updateModelFromViewer()
	Show popover message from there	



*******************************************
 Pri 1 - Postponed
*******************************************
Drag and drop UINeoNodes between networks (worlds)

Reversable actions
	Aggregate actions: actions can be chained, and this chain undone.

Custom file format

Brain View interface
Click to bring a cross section to front, zooming between sections

1. What operations are undoable? I think it would be nice if
	    everything was (including object removals & layout changes). Would
	    this be hard?
		
		There are two primary types of user actions in the Interface. Standard Action and Reversible Action. Layout algorithms are undoable, but individual node movements aren't yet. I'll add "make node layout changes undooable" to my todo list.
		There are some concerns about object removals. It's somewhat difficult because I have to remember not only the Node that was removed but the connections, probes, etc... that it had. Also, some networks take up quite a lot of memory, and keeping them in the undo history would keep them from removal. Perhaps I can make some types of object removals undooable?
 
information visualization
	dimensions of functions, nodes
	
*******************************************
 Pri 2 - will do eventually
*******************************************
set the title of the Swing Frame to that of the maximized Zoomable Window

units selection for UI Dialog

Edit properties of existing models

keyboard search of nodes (auto-panning)

For Jung Layout algorithms, consider making WorldObject a Vertice, or making a Vertice Wrapper for world objects

hot keys to change the level of semantic detail in the view. ie. press ctrl to see Node properties

Write a help doc

*******************************************
 Pri 3 - maybe if there's time
*******************************************
Lenses to show/hide information

Unconnected lines should be highlighted
	
Redo functionality to allow duplicate actions to be performed



*******************************************
 Requests

02/26/2008 - Exposed terminations & origins are now yellow
			You can see their exposed name in the tooltip
			Be careful, projections cover the exposed terminations' color 
			(is this ok? since only one projection is allowed per termination anyways)

02/22/2008 - Disabling full-screen mode until issues resolved\

02/13/2008 - Sorting fixed 
02/13/2008 - Fixed concurrency issue whereby two threads tried to add projections at once.
			 All model update events are executed in a pending thread. 
			 I didn't do this earlier because I thought I'd move all unify all UI update operations in one function, which I now think is impractical.  
02/13/2008 - Projection popup messages now have the format NodeName.PortName
02/13/2008 - Removed StorageName from NEFEnsemble constructor 
			 Note: you can disable tooltips from showing automatically in the "World" menu. This setting is saved between sessions.
			 You can force them to show intentially, but holding down the "ctrl" key.
