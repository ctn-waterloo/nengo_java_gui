Apply actions to selected items


Make drag handler undooable
	1. What operations are undoable? I think it would be nice if
	    everything was (including object removals & layout changes). Would
	    this be hard?
		
		There are two primary types of user actions in the Interface. Standard Action and Reversible Action. Layout algorithms are undoable, but individual node movements aren't yet. I'll add "make node layout changes undooable" to my todo list.
		There are some concerns about object removals. It's somewhat difficult because I have to remember not only the Node that was removed but the connections, probes, etc... that it had. Also, some networks take up quite a lot of memory, and keeping them in the undo history would keep them from removal. Perhaps I can make some types of object removals undooable?
 




show simulation progress in UI
	create a listener object for Simulator

set simulator

information visualization
	dimensions of functions, nodes
	
re-order popup menus to be more intuitive

mouse handlers should draw frames in the sky

*******************************************
 Pri 1 - to do
*******************************************


create exceptions

There are some bugs with the new Function Input configuration.  I'll fix that soon.

The function list is built in FunctionInputPanel. Each function in the list is a description wrapper that describes the properties of the function to configure and their names. 

show open windows


Connection Weights
- I think I know why it isn't acting as an integrator -- it looks like
there is no way to set connection weights on a projection? (something
like a spreadsheet-style matrix editor would be good)



*******************************************
 Pri 2 - will do eventually
*******************************************
fix the color coding issues with frames on selection, context menu and during drag

debug paint calls using PDebug

add keyboard shortcuts

Rectangular group select cursor

optimize data structures

2) Methods getDocumentation() and setDocumentation() added to Node.
(Although I think we were going to defer documentation until later.) I
thought about using wrappers, but this would be a bit of a nuissance
as we would have to wrap NodeFactory instances for the UI. Let me know
if you have any thoughts on this.

Contiunous updating layouts (ie SpringLayout).

getInformation method for Nodes, for tooltips

units selection for UI Dialog

convert Iconfiguration's isConfigured option to a exception thrown and caught by ConfigManager

Complete java docs

Edit properties of existing models

keyboard search of nodes (auto-panning)

For Jung Layout algorithms, consider making WorldObject a Vertice, or making a Vertice Wrapper for world objects

hot keys to change the level of semantic detail in the view. ie. press ctrl to see Node properties

Write an short instruction doc

*******************************************
 Pri 3 - maybe if there's time
*******************************************
Lenses

Customize FileChooser to add extensions

unconnected lines should be highlighted
	
Ctrl-key to enable popups (even when autopops are turned off)


redo functionality to allow duplicate actions to be performed

*******************************************
 Bugs
*******************************************
fixed bug: ensure threads are safety accessing the piccolo graph
fixed bug: debug the events related with adding and removing connections
fixed bug: window appears underneath lines and widgets

*******************************************
 Bryan requests
*******************************************
Ensemble's don't have metadata, can't save layout information

visualization... what information should be most visible? how to edit
what are the ways to create an ensemble?

more Network examples

Require events notification
	show scopes data in real time from the UI

talk about brain view

*******************************************
 Previously Done
*******************************************
Added option to sort nodes alphabetically/by type
Cleaned up configuration code
started documentation

FunctionInputs can now be created with multiple dimensions


create help tips

Move about text to application layer, add getAppName to application layer
	application layer = NeoGraphics

Double clicking on Menu Status bar maximizes it, 
context menu of menu bar is inhereted from Window content object.

11. NOT DONE w/ Notes
Bryan, can you add the change name function to the Node API? It's not trivial,
because Node names are unique and are referenced by hashmaps in places such as the 
Network.
	11. should be able to edit the names of the functions/populations by
	clicking

15. NOT DONE
AXON and current are of the class EnsembleOrigin, they are not probeable.
They also do not appear in the Ensemble's listStates. 
Bryan: How do I probe these?
Investigating 
	15. can't add probes to the ensemble 'current' and 'AXON' origins (which
	are hidden by default).



7. DONE w/ Notes
The default template is created after the first run. 
The function index lets the user select which function from the function 
array to plot. The min and max represent the array bounds (I renamed the 
string to make it a little clearer). 
	7. the plot function on input needs boxes set by default, e.g.
	start:0, increment:.01, end:1  (this could be a 'default template'
	on the first run).  We're not sure what the first integer argument
	is min:0 max:0, and just set it to 0...?


13. DONE w/ Notes
Windows are restored to their original size once Minimized.
Window buttons have also been changed: minimize always minimizes, and 
"cycle" cycles through visible states (maximize and windowed). 

Note that Closing the window using "x", will destroy the window 
contents (positions and zoom levels are remembered, but the window 
position goes back to the default.)

	13. when the container viewer is closed (note: the window title is
	'network viewer') and re-opened, it goes back to a defaul full
	screen instead of the last window state (position, size, zoom
	level, etc.).

21. DONE w/ Notes
Could not reproduce. 
When a new network is created from the file menu, 
it is opened by default. This is because the Network model is added to the top-most
viewer and may be hidden by other network viewers. To add a Network model
to the existing viewer, right-click within the viewer and use the popup-menu
instead.
	** 21. after starting from scratch and adding a network, you can't view it.


5. DONE
Weights information added, and weights editor added
	**5. The weights info on terminations is junk... matrix size may
	be useful.  **Is there a way to edit the weights?

14. DONE
I can no longer reproduce this. 
May have been fixed with changes to the weights editor.

	**14.  it crashed when we attempted to add a decoded termination to
	the population:Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0"
	java.lang.NullPointerException
	       at ca.neo.ui.models.nodes.widgets.GProbe.<init>(GProbe.java:45)
       
17. DONE
Weights editor added
**17. there should be a way to add a decoded origin to the population


8.DONE
Removed hover handling which showed origins and terminations on mouse over
	8. perhaps origins shouldn't pop-up when you scroll over a population
	after you've hidden them.

1. DONE
Recurrent connections are drawn as an arc
	1. recurrent connections (from the output to input of the same
	population) should go around the population (not through
	as currently)

2. DONE
Fixed bug
	2. When saving and reopening a network, the lay out is changed &
	should be preserved

3. DONE
Fixed bug
	3. Fit on screen should make the network as large as possible, it
	seemed to go to a default size (which was small on our screen)

4. DONE
Fixed bug
	4. double-clicking on origins results in a triangle in the bottom
	left, pointing at the origin that seems to have no function

6. DONE
	6. documentation on, e.g., input function should support paragraphs,
	and have a larger, box, input area.  Current contents should
	be presented for editing on a second 'set'...


9. DONE
Probes can be added in ensemble
	9. we aren't able to add probes in the container viewer (i.e., viewing
	all neurons in the population)

10. DONE
	10. would it make more sense for the neurons to be arranged in a square
	rather than long rectangle?

16. DONE
File extensions now added, file names remembered, and file save is prompted on exit.
	16. when closing the program, it should prompt to save changes to the
	simulation

18. DONE
fixed
	18. hiding widgets results in the recurrent connection disappearing.

19. DONE
fixed
	19. grid off doesn't show until you interact with the window again

20. DONE
fixed
	20. 'create new' has a 'P' in front of a bunch of the names?
