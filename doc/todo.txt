*******************************************
 Done
*******************************************
02/12/2008 - Fixed null listener on VisiblyMutable, (turns out it was a base class intializer calling that funciton before it was intialized)
02/12/2008 - All top level objects are registered in Script Console
02/12/2008 - Applied style to script editor
02/12/2008 - Fixed memory leak in window
02/12/2008 - Renamed to Nengo



02/12/2008 - Script console now notified of current object, and top level network add/removes
02/12/2008 - Hooked up listeners for VisiblyMutuble, however many changes are not reflected in UI yet (such as projection add/removes)
02/12/2008 - Configuration panel opens in new window

*******************************************
 Pri 0 - doing next
*******************************************
UIFunctions should never modify the model. 
	Model modification should be done externally, UI Picks up on them through listener 
	AddNeoNode should be private, as you should never be adding nodes explicitly
	All UI Changes should occur through UpdateViewFromModel

Detect projection removals, scan through all origins and terminations, 
	looking for projections, then remove the one's which don't exist anymore

Scan through nodes in NetworkViewer, adding/ removing nodes

Show popover message when model is updated
	Consolidate all viewer updates in updateModelFromViewer()
	Show popover message from there	


Show decoration border around singly selected objects in NeoGraphics

Add alltop-level objects to ScriptConsole


Print used memory to UI console

Done - WorldGround is now destroyed upon world destruction, however there are still some memory leaks
	associated with nested windows.
	Make more comprehensive memory test, open Ensemble sometimes, open sub windows

Nengo.ca links don't work in IE

Projections are not updated in network yet, listener... 
Only register top level networks (what about other types of nodes??

Script console having problem with network with spaces in names.


Drag and drop UINeoNodes between networks (worlds)


Reversable actions
	Aggregate actions: actions can be chained, and this chain undone.
	

*******************************************
 Pri 1 - to do
*******************************************

Custom file format

Brain View interface
Click to bring a cross section to front, zooming between sections

1. What operations are undoable? I think it would be nice if
	    everything was (including object removals & layout changes). Would
	    this be hard?
		
		There are two primary types of user actions in the Interface. Standard Action and Reversible Action. Layout algorithms are undoable, but individual node movements aren't yet. I'll add "make node layout changes undooable" to my todo list.
		There are some concerns about object removals. It's somewhat difficult because I have to remember not only the Node that was removed but the connections, probes, etc... that it had. Also, some networks take up quite a lot of memory, and keeping them in the undo history would keep them from removal. Perhaps I can make some types of object removals undooable?
 
information visualization
	dimensions of functions, nodes
	
*******************************************
 Pri 2 - will do eventually
*******************************************
set the title of the Swing Frame to that of the maximized Zoomable Window

units selection for UI Dialog

Edit properties of existing models

keyboard search of nodes (auto-panning)

For Jung Layout algorithms, consider making WorldObject a Vertice, or making a Vertice Wrapper for world objects

hot keys to change the level of semantic detail in the view. ie. press ctrl to see Node properties

Write a help doc

*******************************************
 Pri 3 - maybe if there's time
*******************************************
Lenses to show/hide information

Unconnected lines should be highlighted
	
Redo functionality to allow duplicate actions to be performed



*******************************************
 Requests
*******************************************
Event notifications from Models
