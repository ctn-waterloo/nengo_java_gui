bug: affinity window dosen't show upon launch
bug: ensure threads are safety accessing the piccolo graph

Bryan "
done-Undo & redo would be a big help
done - It would be nice to have an easy way to maximize the network viewer
(controls in upper-right corner like windows would be good)
done- When a node is deleted, its origins and terminations should also be deleted
done- There should be either scrollbars or a fit-on-screen function (I
lost a function in the infinite network viewer)


- I think I know why it isn't acting as an integrator -- it looks like
there is no way to set connection weights on a projection? (something
like a spreadsheet-style matrix editor would be good)
- There should be separate options for removing and hiding origins
(some can't be removed but we don't want to see them)
- There should be a plot option for function nodes (with user-defined domain)
- When a projection is removed the corresponding origin and
termination should remain

getInformation method for Nodes, for tooltips

update configureModel functions to check if existing models exist, and configure them 


	create a UIDelegateAction function

constructUIObject function should be added to all nodes

read in an existing network and draw it
	need to get reference to Node parent from origin and termination
	

integrate graph layout algorithms


add directions to edges
units selection for UI Dialog



create tooltips to show connection and disconnection events
	probe added text

garbage collection of removed objects
