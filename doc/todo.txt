 Pri 0 - doing next
*******************************************
File menu, to load saved networks (Use Swing File Dialogs)
Save network from NetworkViewer, or PNetwork

 Pri 1 - to do
*******************************************
Connection Weights
- I think I know why it isn't acting as an integrator -- it looks like
there is no way to set connection weights on a projection? (something
like a spreadsheet-style matrix editor would be good)
- There should be separate options for removing and hiding origins
(some can't be removed but we don't want to see them)
- There should be a plot option for function nodes (with user-defined domain)
- When a projection is removed the corresponding origin and
termination should remain

Ctrl-key to enable popups (even when autopops are turned off)

done-Undo & redo would be a big help
done - It would be nice to have an easy way to maximize the network viewer
(controls in upper-right corner like windows would be good)
done- When a node is deleted, its origins and terminations should also be deleted
done- There should be either scrollbars or a fit-on-screen function (I
lost a function in the infinite network viewer)


*******************************************
 Pri 2 - will do eventually
*******************************************

fading popup texts as a lightweight way to notify of 
  events such as connections, changes, etc...

Rectangular group select cursor

2) Methods getDocumentation() and setDocumentation() added to Node.
(Although I think we were going to defer documentation until later.) I
thought about using wrappers, but this would be a bit of a nuissance
as we would have to wrap NodeFactory instances for the UI. Let me know
if you have any thoughts on this.

Contiunous updating layouts (ie SpringLayout).

getInformation method for Nodes, for tooltips

units selection for UI Dialog

create tooltips to show connection and disconnection events
	probe added text

Ensure correct implementation of destroy() function for UI Objects

paint nodes as shapes rather than icons at high zooms

convert Iconfiguration's isConfigured option to a exception thrown and caught by ConfigManager

add java docs
