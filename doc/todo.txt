 Done
*******************************************
12/18/2007 - Create graph from ElasticObject and Edge
12/17/2007 - Spring Layout done
12/17/2007 - New prettier window icons
12/17/2007 - Sequential popup messages no longer overlap

*******************************************
 Pri 0 - doing next
*******************************************

	In ElasticGround, attach to that event in edges and children.
	If detected, update graph()
	Create graph from ElasticObject and Edge
	


Create a test which creates a Network via UI and compares results
	are results deterministic?
	

Transient messages should not fall off the screen
	reference tooltips code
Transient messages should follow the objects
	reference tooltips code

TODO:
    * Dynamic class loading
    * Adding comments to new code
    * Reversable actions
    * Fixing the ugly window icons


Doing next:

Add weak reference to UI Nodes from DataListView
	Support feature such as focus on node (check node.isDestroyed && node is not hidden)

Request: A notification when model changes, this way it will trigger a UI update
	UpdateUIFromModel()
		Ensembles - origins and terminations have to be checked

Aggregate actions: actions can be chained, and this chain undone.

    * Network exposeOrigin & exposeTermination
    * Investigate loading code on the fly
    * Drag & Drop improvements (might support future features)
    	3) It would be great if people could load their own code on the fly,
		e.g. by going to the file system for a jar. I'm a little hazy on
		classloading, but this is straightforward, right? If you load the
		first UI class with a custom classloader, then the custom classloader
		should be used from then on? And the custom classloader could just be
		URLClassLoader, with addURL(...) made public?



Proper labelling for multiple plots 

Ah, I don't think we'd talked about supporting that last thing in the UI, but it would be good (e.g. right-click an origin and select "externalize").
Or "expose" rather. See Network.exposeOrigin() and exposeTermination()

Clean up menus

Replacing ensembles in place - Instead, why not change parameters


Manage views: Network, Brain, Data


*******************************************
 Pri 1 - to do
*******************************************

Handle on user-end, when a chosen template does not fit in configurable. 
ie. when PFunctionArray's input dimensions are incompatible with given functions.

Custom file format

Allow creation of multi-dimensional fourier functions

Structure the popup menus for better usability

Brain View interface
Click to bring a cross section to front, zooming between sections

1. What operations are undoable? I think it would be nice if
	    everything was (including object removals & layout changes). Would
	    this be hard?
		
		There are two primary types of user actions in the Interface. Standard Action and Reversible Action. Layout algorithms are undoable, but individual node movements aren't yet. I'll add "make node layout changes undooable" to my todo list.
		There are some concerns about object removals. It's somewhat difficult because I have to remember not only the Node that was removed but the connections, probes, etc... that it had. Also, some networks take up quite a lot of memory, and keeping them in the undo history would keep them from removal. Perhaps I can make some types of object removals undooable?
 
information visualization
	dimensions of functions, nodes
	
*******************************************
 Pri 2 - will do eventually
*******************************************
set the title of the Swing Frame to that of the maximized Zoomable Window

optimize data structures

Contiunous updating layouts (ie SpringLayout).

units selection for UI Dialog

Edit properties of existing models

keyboard search of nodes (auto-panning)

For Jung Layout algorithms, consider making WorldObject a Vertice, or making a Vertice Wrapper for world objects

hot keys to change the level of semantic detail in the view. ie. press ctrl to see Node properties

Write a help doc

*******************************************
 Pri 3 - maybe if there's time
*******************************************
Lenses to show/hide information

Unconnected lines should be highlighted
	
Redo functionality to allow duplicate actions to be performed



*******************************************
 Requests
*******************************************
Event notifications from Models

*******************************************
