Welcome to Nengo!  <http://nengo.ca>
    
Nengo is an open-source neural simulator for large-scale systems, developed at
the University of Waterloo by the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience.

This is the command-line interface, useful for quickly running scripts and
for embedding Nengo within other research tools.  There is also a graphical
user interface available by running 'nengo' (rather than 'nengo-cl', which
is this program).

The scripting language is Python.  You can run .py scripts as follows:
    execfile('directory/script.py')
You can also create models manually and even run the interactive plots viewer:
    import nef
    net=nef.Network('My Network')
    input=net.make_input('input',[0])
    A=net.make('A',neurons=50,dimensions=1)
    net.connect(input,A)
    net.view()
"""
    # start an interactive console
    sys.argv=['-i']
    import org.python.util
    interp=org.python.util.JLineConsole(locals())
    interp.interact()
